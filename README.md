# Teston-Super-Mare

## Set up

Run `npm i` in both the `teston-super-mare` and `server-side` directories to install node_modules.

## Start up

To start up the front end in development mode, run `npm start` from the `teston-super-mare` directory.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
It should automatically reload the page after code changes and show any lint errors/warnings.

To start up the back end, in another terminal window run `npm start` from the `server-side` directory.
This is also where `console.log` in the server-side code outputs to.
